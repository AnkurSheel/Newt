# Other Questions

## What is net worth and why should I care?
Net worth is the difference between your assets and your liabilities. Positive net worth means that you own more than you owe. On the other hand, a negative net worth means that you owe more than you own.
You generally want to see your net worth go up. Tracking your net worth is one of the first steps if you want to pursue a financial peace of mind.

## A spreadsheet works fine - Why should I use this application? 
This is exactly the question I asked myself before starting to build the software. Earlier, I was tracking our networth using an excel spread sheet but I was getting tired of updating cell references and formulas to see the progress. I am by no means an excel wizard and adding complexity to the chart was becoming time consuming. Also, I find it easier to write code than tinkering with Excel.
 
By using this app, I can see the progress immediately after entering the data.

The software is by no means complete and there are still a few features that I want to add.

## Why is there just a desktop version?
A desktop version is easier compared to an online or mobile version as I don't have to worry about things like authentication and browsers.

Depending on the interest, I might build a web and/or mobile version but **No Promises** at this time
